# My Attempt at the Odin Recipes Project

This repository contains my attempt at the Odin Recipes project, a part of The Odin Project curriculum. In this project, I'll be building a basic recipe website by following the provided instructions.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several iterations, each focusing on different aspects of HTML and web development. Here's a brief summary of what I'll be doing:

- **Iteration 1: Initial Structure**: Creating the main index.html file and adding the title "Odin Recipes".
- **Iteration 2: Recipe Page**: Creating individual recipe pages within the "recipes" directory and linking them to the index page.
- **Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content**: Adding images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps to the recipe pages.
- **Iteration 4: Adding More Recipes**: Expanding the project by adding more recipes and linking them to the index page.

## Project Progress

As I work through each iteration, I'll be updating this repository to reflect my progress. You can check the files and commit history to see how I've implemented each aspect of the project.
